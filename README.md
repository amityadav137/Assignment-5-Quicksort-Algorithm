# Assignment 5: Quicksort Algorithm - Implementation, Analysis, and Randomization

## Overview

This project contains:

- Deterministic Quicksort Implementation
- Randomized Quicksort Implementation
- Empirical comparison of both algorithms

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amityadav137/Assignment-5-Quicksort-Algorithm.git
cd Assignment-5-Quicksort-Algorithm
```

2. Run the deterministic version:

```bash
python deterministic_quicksort.py
```

3. Run the randomized version:

```bash
python randomized_quicksort.py
```

4. Run empirical comparison:

```bash
python empirical_analysis.py
```

## Summary of Findings

- Randomized Quicksort consistently performs better on sorted/reverse data.
- Average-case complexity for both is O(n log n), worst-case for deterministic is O(nÂ²).
